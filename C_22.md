- Use a physics engine to create a world and the objects in them. 
- Integrate the physics engine with the p5 code to create interactive objects following the rules of physics in this world. 
- Tune the physics engine to change the behavior of the objects in your world.

STEP:

1. We are going to learn a few more necessary details which we would need to use when we finally start designing angry birds game.

   * When we create each object in the game, each of it must follow the rules of physics (nature) - like gravity, bounceoff, collision detection etc. 

   * We can create each object and give these properties to each object we create. And then we can program how each object should interact with another. 

   * But such a program would get quite difficult to write and manage?

   * Developers have worked on this problem before and created a library. 

   * The library helps us create a world where all the objects follow the rules of physics which we define for them. 

   * So, whenever an object is created, it already has bounce off, collision detection, gravity and many other properties. 

   * We call such a library - a physics engine. We can change the behavior of the objects in this world by tuning our physics engine. 

   * We will be making the Angry Birds Game using such a physics engine.

   * There are many different kinds of libraries for the physics engine in javascript. 

   * Some of the popular ones are **box2d, matter.js, p2.js**. 

   * In our projects, we will be using matter.js as our **Physics engine.**

     

2. Download  the boiler plate code and unzips it in a folder called PhysicsEngine.

   * To use the matter.js library in our project, we need to modify the index.html file to add the script tag for the library. 

   * We can do it in two ways: - 

   * ###### We can download the matter.js library, keep it in our current folder and add the script tag OR - 

   * ###### We can use a matter.js library uploaded on a cloud network and add the script tag with src as the link for the file.

     adds the script tag in the index.html file:

        

      <script
     src="https://unpkg.com/matter-js@0.1
     4.2/build/matter.min.js"></script>

   

3.  open our script.js file and create a canvas.

   * draw a rectangle at the centre in the canvas.

     ```javascript
     function setup() {
       var canvas = createCanvas(400,400);
     
     }
     
     function draw() {
       background(255,255,255);  
       rect(200,200,50,50)
     
     }
     ```

     

* Notice how we have given the x-coordinate and y-coordinate of the rectangle as 200, 200 which is the centre of the canvas. But the rectangle is not at the centre.

* we can instruct the computer to take the x and y coordinates to be at the centre of the rectangle. To do this, we need to tell the computer rectMode(CENTER).

  ```javascript
  function setup() {
    var canvas = createCanvas(400,400);
  
  }
  
  function draw() {
    background(255,255,255); 
    rectMode(CENTER);
     rect(200,200,50,50)
  
  }
  
  ```

  

* But this isn't an object and it doesn't follow any rules of physics. We have to use the physics engine in matter.js for that.

* Let's create a **Ground** using the **physics engine**. To use the physics engine, we will use **three objects created in Matter.js** library -> **World, Engine and Bodies.**

* **Engine** is used to create the physics engine. 

* **World** is used to create the physical world and add objects to it. 

* **Bodies** is used to create the physical objects which inhabit the world.

* Since these objects are a part of Matter library, they are referenced as **Matter.World, Matter.Engine and Matter.Bodies.** 

* Let's rename them as World, Engine and Bodies so that it is easy to write and read our code. This is called **namespacing** in programming.

* **const** is just like var - except you cannot change the value stored in a const anywhere in your program. 

  ```javascript
  const Engine = Matter.Engine;
  const World= Matter.World;
  const Bodies = Matter.Bodies;
  ```

  

4. Let us create our physics engine. As soon as you create a physics engine, a new world is created using the physics engine.

   **var engine, world;**

   ```javascript
   function setup()
   {
       
       engine = Engine.create();
       world = engine.world;
   }
   ```

   

5. Now let's make an object in this world. We use Bodies to create a body in this world. Let's create a rectangular body in the world just above the previous rectangle.

   ```javascript
   var object;
   function setup()
   {
     object = Bodies.rectangle(200,200,50,50);
     
      World.add(world,object);
   }
   
   function draw()
   {
     background(255,255,255); 
     rectMode(CENTER);
      rect(200,200,50,50); 
   }
   
   ```

   6. Do we see another body other than the rectangle we had drawn?

      * NO. 

      * WHY ? 

      * The rectangular body is created in the computer's memory but we are not drawing or showing it anywhere. Let's see what is the value inside object by printing it on the console.

        ```javascript
        function setup()
        {
        console.log(object);
        }
        ```

        * right click inside the browser and see the console output by pressing on inspect. 

        * We see a lot of attributes (id, label, parts etc.) inside { }

        * In Javascript any object is stored inside a { }. 

        * All the attributes inside the object are its properties like - id, labet etc. 

        * Each property has a value and we can access them by object.attributename 

        * For example, let's print this object type on the console. 

        * You just need to write console.log(object.type)

        * If you click on the arrow to the left of the object we have created, you will see it has many attributes. It also has an attribute called position.

        * How we can print the x and y of this object?

          ```javascript
          console.log(object.position.x)
          console.log(object.position.y)
          ```

        * Now, in the draw function - instead of drawing a rectangle at any position, let's draw it at the position of our object.

          ```javascript
          function draw()
          {
            background(255);
            Engine.update(engine);
          rect(object.position.x,object.position.y,50,50);
          }
          ```

        * The rectangular object starts dropping from its position.

        * WHY?

        * This is because as our physics engine is running - the values of x and y position of our object is continuously updated. Since our object has gravity (this is in-built in our physics engine), it starts to fall. Our rectangle in draw() is drawn at the positions of our object, so we see the falling rectangle.

        * But what if we wanted a static rectangle? No problem. 

        * We can pass this option when we create our rectangle body object. 

   7.  Rename the "object" to "ground" and draw it at the desired width, height and position.

```javascript
var ground;
```

```javascript
function setup()
{
    
     var ground_options ={
        isStatic: true
    }
ground = Bodies.rectangle(200,390,200,20,ground_options);
  
    World.add(world,ground);
}
```

* This is because we have asked the physics engine to make this body as static. The rectangle is static at one place.

  

7.  will create a ball which bounces on the ground like a tennis ball and then comes to rest.

* We use Bodies.circle to create a circular game object. 
* Bodies.circle takes 3 arguments - x position, y position and radius. We use ellipse to draw it. 
* We change the ellipseMode to RADIUS

```javascript
var ball;
function setup()
{
  
    ball = Bodies.circle(200,100,20, ball_options);
    World.add(world,ball);
}

function draw()
{
    background(0);
    Engine.update(engine);
    rectMode(CENTER);
    rect(ground.position.x,ground.position.y,400,20);

    ellipseMode(RADIUS);
    ellipse(ball.position.x, ball.position.y, 20, 20);
}
```

* Our ball is created and it falls to the ground. But it isn't bouncing like a tennis ball.
* In physics, bounciness of an object is called "restitution". We can change the restitution of an object and create the bounciness effect.

8. You can play around more with the physics engine and create more things by reading the documentation in your student activity link 2.

# What we studied in today's class?

1. We learned about matter.js and how it can be used to create a physics engine. 
2. How objects can be created and its behavior can be changed using the physics engine. 
3. We learned how an object is stored inside a {}
